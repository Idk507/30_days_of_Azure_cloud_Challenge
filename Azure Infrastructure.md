# üåê Azure Infrastructure ‚Äì From Foundations to Mastery

---

## ‚úÖ What is Azure Infrastructure?

**Azure Infrastructure** refers to the core foundational components and services offered by Microsoft Azure that enable organizations to build, host, scale, and manage cloud-based solutions. It encompasses **compute, networking, storage, and security layers**, all managed through a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers.

## üîß Core Components of Azure Infrastructure

| Layer                   | Components                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Compute                 | VMs, App Services, Functions, AKS, ACI       |
| Networking              | VNet, Load Balancers, NSG, VPN, ExpressRoute |
| Storage                 | Blob, Disk, File, Queue, Archive             |
| Identity & Security     | Azure AD, RBAC, PIM, Firewall, Key Vault     |
| Monitoring & Management | Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Azure Policy   |

## üåç 1. Azure Global Infrastructure

### a. **Regions**

* Physical locations worldwide (e.g., East US, West Europe).
* Each region has multiple **data centers** for redundancy.
* Paired for **disaster recovery** and **compliance**.

### b. **Availability Zones**

* Separate **physical locations** within a region.
* High Availability (99.99%) through **zone-redundant services**.

### c. **Geographies**

* Grouped regions to comply with **data residency** laws (e.g., Europe, US, Asia).
* Useful for **sovereign clouds** and multi-national organizations.

## üñ•Ô∏è 2. Compute Infrastructure

### a. **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)**

* IaaS compute, fully customizable
* Supports Windows & Linux
* Use-cases: Legacy apps, lift-and-shift, dev/test

### b. **Azure App Service**

* PaaS for hosting web apps, REST APIs
* Built-in scaling and DevOps
* Supports .NET, Java, Python, Node.js

### c. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**

* Managed Kubernetes cluster
* Scalable microservice architecture
* Ideal for containerized workloads

### d. **Azure Functions**

* Event-driven serverless computing
* Use-cases: APIs, automation, background jobs

### e. **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**

* Lightweight containers on demand
* No orchestration needed

---

## üåê 3. Networking Infrastructure

### a. **Virtual Network (VNet)**

* Isolated private network
* Subnets, IP ranges, routing control

### b. **Load Balancer**

* Distributes traffic across VMs and services
* Supports internal and external traffic

### c. **Application Gateway**

* Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) load balancing
* Web Application Firewall (WAF) included

### d. **VPN Gateway**

* Secure connection between on-premises and Azure

### e. **ExpressRoute**

* Private connection to Azure bypassing the public internet
* High bandwidth, low latency

### f. **Private Link**

* Access Azure services privately via internal IPs

---

## üíæ 4. Storage Infrastructure

### a. **Azure Blob Storage**

* Object storage for images, videos, documents
* Tiers: Hot, Cool, Archive

### b. **Azure Disk Storage**

* Persistent block storage for VMs
* Premium SSD, Standard SSD/HDD

### c. **Azure Files**

* Fully managed file shares accessible via SMB

### d. **Storage Security**

* Encrypted at rest using Storage Service Encryption
* Integration with Azure Key Vault for CMK

---

## üîê 5. Identity & Access Infrastructure

### a. **Azure Active Directory**

* Identity management platform
* SSO, MFA, B2B, B2C, Conditional Access

### b. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**

* Fine-grained access control to Azure resources

### c. **Azure Key Vault**

* Securely store secrets, keys, and certificates

### d. **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**

* JIT access, audit trail for privileged roles

---

## üì° 6. Monitoring & Governance

### a. **Azure Monitor**

* Collects metrics and logs from resources
* Integrated with Log Analytics, Alerts

### b. **Azure Log Analytics**

* Query logs with KQL
* Dashboarding and analytics

### c. **Azure Policy**

* Enforce organizational standards
* Example: Only allow resources in a specific region

### d. **Azure Cost Management**

* Track usage, set budgets, and manage costs

---

## üìä 7. Resource Organization

### a. **Management Groups**

* Group subscriptions for RBAC and policies

### b. **Subscriptions**

* Isolated environments with billing boundaries

### c. **Resource Groups**

* Logical grouping of related resources

### d. **Tags**

* Metadata to classify and track resources

## üõ† Real-World Use Case: Hosting a Scalable Web App

**Scenario**: A company wants to host a web application accessible globally with high availability and performance.

**Solution**:

1. **Compute**: Use Azure App Service or AKS
2. **Storage**: Store media files in Azure Blob
3. **Networking**:

   * VNet + Subnets for isolation
   * Application Gateway with WAF
4. **Identity**:

   * Users sign in via Azure AD
   * Managed Identity to access Key Vault
5. **Security**:

   * Firewall, NSG, and DDoS protection
6. **Monitoring**:

   * Azure Monitor for health checks
   * Alerts for CPU usage, failures

---

## üéØ Best Practices for Azure Infrastructure

* Design for **high availability** using AZs and region pairing
* Follow **least privilege access** with RBAC and PIM
* Use **private endpoints** for all critical services
* Integrate **CI/CD pipelines** with Azure DevOps or GitHub
* Secure data with **encryption** and **Key Vault**
* Use **infrastructure as code (IaC)** with Bicep or Terraform
* Enable **monitoring, logging, and alerts** from day one
