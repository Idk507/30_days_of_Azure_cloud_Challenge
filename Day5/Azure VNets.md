### **Azure Networking: Virtual Network & Security Concepts**

Azure provides a robust networking framework that allows users to create secure, scalable, and highly available network infrastructures. One of the core components is **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)**, which acts as a private, logically isolated network within Azure.

---

## **1. Virtual Network (VNet)**
A **Virtual Network (VNet)** in Azure is a **logical** and **secure** boundary that enables communication between Azure resources. It allows Azure services (like Virtual Machines, App Services, and Kubernetes clusters) to communicate with each other and extend connectivity to on-premises networks.

### **Key Features of VNet**
- **Isolation**: Each VNet is isolated from others, ensuring security and preventing data leakage.
- **Subnetting**: VNets can be divided into **subnets** for resource grouping and traffic segmentation.
- **Address Space**: VNets use **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** notation to define IP address ranges.

### **Example:**
Imagine a company, **Contoso Ltd.**, hosting an application in Azure. They need to deploy:
1. A **Web Server** (Public-facing)
2. An **Application Server** (Internal)
3. A **Database Server** (Highly secured)

They create a **VNet (10.0.0.0/16)** and divide it into subnets:
- **Web Subnet**: `10.0.1.0/24` (for Web Server)
- **App Subnet**: `10.0.2.0/24` (for Application Server)
- **DB Subnet**: `10.0.3.0/24` (for Database Server)

This setup improves security and allows controlled communication.

## **2. Subnets & CIDR**
### **Subnets**
A **Subnet** is a **logical partition** within a Virtual Network. It helps in:
- Organizing resources
- Controlling network traffic
- Applying **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** to restrict access

Each subnet must have a unique IP address range within the VNet.

### **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**
CIDR notation is used to **allocate IP address ranges** efficiently. It defines:
- The **network prefix** (determining the network portion)
- The **host portion** (available IPs for devices)

#### **Example:**
If a VNet has the **IP range** `192.168.1.0/24`, it means:
- **Network portion**: `192.168.1`
- **Host portion**: `.1 to .254` (254 usable IPs)

**Subnet Example:**
| Subnet Name | Address Range | Number of Usable IPs |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Web Subnet | 192.168.1.0/26 | 62 |
| App Subnet | 192.168.1.64/26 | 62 |
| DB Subnet | 192.168.1.128/26 | 62 |

---

## **3. Routes & Route Tables**
### **Routes**
Routes control **how network traffic flows** between different subnets, VNets, or external networks.

### **Route Tables**
A **Route Table** is a set of routes that define:
- **Destination**: The target network (e.g., `0.0.0.0/0` for the internet)
- **Next Hop**: The next network device (e.g., **Virtual Network Gateway**, **Network Virtual Appliance**)

#### **Example: Custom Route Table**
**Scenario**: You want to route all **Internet traffic** (`0.0.0.0/0`) through a **firewall appliance**.

| Destination | Next Hop Type |
|-------------|--------------|
| 0.0.0.0/0   | Virtual Appliance (Firewall) |
| 10.0.0.0/16 | Virtual Network (VNet) |

---

## **4. Network Security Groups (NSGs)**
NSGs act as **firewalls** at the subnet or NIC level. They define **rules** to allow or deny inbound and outbound traffic.

### **Key Aspects:**
- **Rules**: Define traffic flow based on **Source, Destination, Port, and Protocol**.
- **Default Rules**: Azure provides built-in security rules (e.g., allowing traffic within a VNet).
- **Association**: Can be linked to **subnets** or **network interfaces**.

### **Example: NSG Rules**
| Rule Name | Priority | Source | Destination | Port | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|------|--------|
| AllowHTTP | 100     | Any    | Web Subnet | 80   | Allow |
| AllowSSH  | 200     | Any    | App Subnet | 22   | Allow |
| DenyAll   | 65000   | Any    | Any        | Any  | Deny |

This setup:
- **Allows HTTP (80) traffic to the Web Subnet**
- **Allows SSH (22) for internal management**
- **Denies all other traffic by default**

---

## **5. Application Security Groups (ASGs)**
Application Security Groups (ASGs) simplify network security by grouping VMs based on **application roles**.

### **Key Benefits:**
- **Simplified Security**: Instead of assigning rules to IPs, use logical groups.
- **Dynamic Membership**: VMs are automatically added based on their assigned ASG.
- **Scalability**: Easier security rule management for large applications.

### **Example: ASG for a Multi-Tier App**
A **three-tier application** with:
- **Web Servers**
- **App Servers**
- **Database Servers**

Instead of defining IP-based rules, create **ASGs**:
| ASG Name | VM Role |
|---------|--------|
| `Web-ASG` | Web Server VMs |
| `App-ASG` | Application Server VMs |
| `DB-ASG` | Database Server VMs |

### **NSG Rules using ASGs**
| Rule Name | Source ASG | Destination ASG | Port | Action |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|------|--------|
| AllowWeb  | `Internet` | `Web-ASG` | 80, 443 | Allow |
| AllowApp  | `Web-ASG` | `App-ASG` | 5000 | Allow |
| AllowDB   | `App-ASG` | `DB-ASG` | 1433 | Allow |
| DenyAll   | Any | Any | Any | Deny |
