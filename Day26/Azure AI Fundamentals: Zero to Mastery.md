#### b. **Language**

* **Text Analytics**: Key phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition.
* **Language Understanding (LUIS)**: Intent and entity recognition.
* **Translator**: Real-time translation of 60+ languages.
* **QnA Maker / Azure AI Language**: Build FAQ-based bots.

#### c. **Speech**

* **Speech-to-Text**: Convert spoken words into text.
* **Text-to-Speech**: Read text in natural voices.
* **Speech Translation**: Translate spoken content.

#### d. **Decision**

* **Personalizer**: Real-time content recommendations.
* **Content Moderator**: Detect inappropriate content in text/images.
