# **Azure Data Engineering: Zero to Mastery**

---

## **1. Introduction to Data Engineering on Azure**

### What is Data Engineering?

Data Engineering focuses on **collecting, transforming, and storing** data for **analysis and machine learning**. It enables organizations to make data-driven decisions at scale.

### Why Azure for Data Engineering?

Azure provides a scalable, secure, and end-to-end platform with:

* Managed data storage
* Stream and batch processing
* Orchestration
* Data integration and visualization tools

## **2. Core Concepts in Azure Data Engineering**

| Concept                    | Purpose                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Ingestion             | Collecting data from various sources              |
| Data Storage               | Storing structured, semi-structured, unstructured |
| Data Processing            | Batch or real-time transformation                 |
| Data Orchestration         | Managing data workflows                           |
| Data Analysis              | Querying, reporting, and ML integration           |
| Data Security & Governance | Ensuring secure access and compliance             |

## **3. Key Azure Data Services**

### a. **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS)**

* Scalable object storage built for big data analytics.
* Supports hierarchical namespace (directories).
* Stores raw, curated, and enriched data.

### b. **Azure Synapse Analytics**

* Combines **data warehousing** and **big data analytics**.
* Supports **serverless** SQL, **dedicated SQL pools**, **Apache Spark**, and **Data Explorer pools**.

### c. **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**

* Data **orchestration tool** (ETL/ELT).
* Enables **pipeline creation** for moving and transforming data.
* Supports 90+ data sources (on-prem and cloud).
* GUI-based + code support (JSON, ARM templates).

### d. **Azure Stream Analytics**

* Real-time event processing from devices, apps, and sensors.
* Uses SQL-like language for querying streaming data.
* Supports integration with Power BI, Event Hub, and Cosmos DB.

### e. **Azure Databricks**

* Apache Spark-based analytics platform.
* Ideal for **big data processing, machine learning**, and **advanced analytics**.
* Supports PySpark, Scala, SQL, and MLlib.

### f. **Azure SQL Database & SQL Managed Instance**

* Fully managed relational database services.
* Suitable for OLTP workloads.

### g. **Azure Cosmos DB**

* Globally distributed NoSQL DB.
* Supports multiple APIs: SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table.
* Suitable for high availability, low-latency apps.

---

## **4. Data Ingestion Techniques**

### Sources:

* On-premises databases
* APIs
* Flat files (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
* IoT devices (Edge)

### Ingestion Tools:

* **Azure Data Factory**: Scheduled ingestion pipelines.
* **Event Hub** / **IoT Hub**: Real-time event streaming.

---

## **5. Data Transformation (ETL vs ELT)**

* **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Used with traditional DW systems.
* **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**: Common with cloud-native data lakes.

### Tools:

* **ADF Mapping & Wrangling Data Flows**
* **Databricks Notebooks (Spark SQL, PySpark)**
* **T-SQL in Synapse**
* **Stored procedures**

---

## **6. Real-Time Processing**

### Key Services:

* **Azure Event Hub**: Event ingestion pipeline.
* **Azure Stream Analytics**: Real-time stream processing.
* **Databricks Structured Streaming**: Advanced stream processing with ML.

---

## **7. Batch Processing and Analytics**

* **Synapse Pipelines**
* **ADF with PolyBase/Spark**
* **Databricks Notebooks (batch jobs)**
* **SQL scripts on Synapse SQL Pool**
