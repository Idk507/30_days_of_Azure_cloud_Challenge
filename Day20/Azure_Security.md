# üîê Azure Security ‚Äì From Zero to Mastery

---

## üîé What is Azure Security?

**Azure Security** refers to the **set of technologies, practices, and tools provided by Microsoft Azure** to help organizations protect their **cloud infrastructure, data, identities, and applications**.

Azure follows a **shared responsibility model**:

* **Microsoft**: Secures the physical infrastructure, network, and foundational services.
* **Customer**: Secures data, identities, applications, and controls access.

## üß± Core Pillars of Azure Security

| Pillar                      | Description                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity Security**       | Securing users, services, and identities with tools like Azure AD               |
| **Data Security**           | Protecting data at rest, in transit, and in use                                 |
| **Network Security**        | Secure traffic flow and access control using firewalls, NSGs, and private links |
| **Application Security**    | Ensure secure development and deployment of applications                        |
| **Threat Protection**       | Detect and respond to attacks using Azure-native services                       |
| **Compliance & Governance** | Manage compliance requirements and governance policies                          |

## üîê Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### 1. **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**

* Central identity platform for managing users and access.
* Supports:

  * Single Sign-On (SSO)
  * Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  * Conditional Access
  * Identity Protection
  * Passwordless login

### 2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

* Grant least-privilege access to Azure resources.
* Assign roles like:

  * **Owner**
  * **Contributor**
  * **Reader**
  * Custom Roles

### 3. **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**

* Just-in-time access for privileged accounts
* Temporary elevation of permissions
* Approval workflow and audit trail

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Network Security

### 1. **Network Security Groups (NSG)**

* Controls inbound/outbound traffic to VMs and subnets
* Stateless packet filtering based on rules

### 2. **Azure Firewall**

* Managed, stateful firewall with high availability and scaling
* Threat intelligence-based filtering
* Supports custom DNS, logging, and network rules

### 3. **Azure DDoS Protection**

* Protects against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
* Automatically enabled at the network edge

### 4. **Private Link and VNet Integration**

* Access services privately over Azure backbone
* Prevents exposure to the public internet

### 5. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**

* Protects apps from OWASP top 10 attacks
* Integrated with:

  * **Azure Application Gateway**
  * **Azure Front Door**
  * **Azure CDN**

## üîê Data Protection

### 1. **Encryption**

| Type           | Details                                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **At Rest**    | Uses Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE), Azure Disk Encryption          |
| **In Transit** | Enforced via TLS                                                            |
| **In Use**     | Supported using **Confidential Compute** and Trusted Execution Environments |

* **Customer-Managed Keys (CMK)** or Microsoft-Managed
* Integration with **Azure Key Vault** for secure key management

### 2. **Azure Information Protection (AIP)**

* Classify, label, and protect sensitive information
* Works across Microsoft 365, Azure, and third-party services

---

## ü¶† Threat Detection and Response

### 1. **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**

* Unified cloud-native security posture management (CSPM) and workload protection
* Supports:

  * Security Score
  * Threat detection for VMs, containers, SQL, and more
  * Compliance reports

### 2. **Microsoft Sentinel**

* Cloud-native **SIEM + SOAR** platform
* Collects logs and security signals from:

  * Azure
  * Microsoft 365
  * On-premises & other clouds
* Enables real-time analytics and automated response (Playbooks)

---

## üì¶ Application Security

### 1. **Azure App Service Security**

* Supports identity-based authentication
* Integration with Key Vault for secrets
* TLS/SSL enforcement

### 2. **DevSecOps**

* Integrate security into CI/CD:

  * Use **GitHub Advanced Security**
  * Static Code Analysis with tools like **SonarCloud**
  * Container scanning in ACR

### 3. **Secure Coding Practices**

* OWASP guidance
* Input validation, output encoding
* Secure SDKs and libraries

---

## üßÆ Compliance and Governance

### 1. **Azure Policy**

* Enforce and audit compliance with rules like:

  * No public IP for VMs
  * Enforce TLS 1.2
  * Deploy monitoring automatically

### 2. **Azure Blueprints**

* Package compliant environments (ARM templates + policies + RBAC)
* Ideal for enterprise-scale deployments

### 3. **Microsoft Compliance Manager**

* Track compliance with standards (ISO, GDPR, NIST, etc.)
* Provides control mapping and score
