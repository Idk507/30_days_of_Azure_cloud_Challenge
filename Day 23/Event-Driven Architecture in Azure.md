## 🔁 **Event-Driven Architecture in Azure**

Azure offers multiple services for **handling events and messages**:

| Service               | Primary Use Case                                                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Azure Event Grid**  | **Routing lightweight events** across services (pub/sub model)  |
| **Azure Event Hubs**  | **Streaming large volumes of telemetry/data** from apps/devices |
| **Azure Service Bus** | **Enterprise messaging** (e.g., commands, ordered workflows)    |

Let’s go into detail for each:

---

## 📌 **1. Azure Event Grid** – *Event Routing Backbone*

### ✅ Overview:

Azure Event Grid is a **fully managed event routing service** built for high availability, low latency, and massive scale.

### 🔍 Key Features:

* Push-based model (publish/subscribe)
* Near real-time delivery (sub-second latency)
* Built-in support for 1st and 3rd party Azure services (e.g., Blob Storage, Functions)
* Uses **CloudEvents 1.0** schema (open standard)
* Up to **10 million events per second per region**

### 📦 Event Grid Terminology:

| Term                   | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Event Publisher**    | Source that emits events (e.g., Blob Storage, IoT Hub)       |
| **Event Topic**        | Endpoint where events are published                          |
| **Event Subscription** | Defines where to send events (e.g., Azure Function, Webhook) |
| **Event Handler**      | The destination that processes the event                     |

### 🧩 Real-Time Example: Image Processing

1. User uploads an image to **Azure Blob Storage**.
2. Event Grid detects the upload and triggers an **Azure Function**.
3. The Function resizes and stores a thumbnail.

### ✅ When to Use:

* Microservices eventing
* Serverless triggers
* Reacting to resource changes
* Lightweight event routing between Azure services

## 📌 **2. Azure Event Hubs** – *Big Data Ingestion Pipeline*

### ✅ Overview:

Azure Event Hubs is a **big data streaming platform and event ingestion service** capable of processing millions of events per second.

### 🔍 Key Features:

* Built for **telemetry, log, or metrics ingestion** (high throughput)
* Supports **Apache Kafka** protocol
* Low-latency data ingestion from devices or apps
* Event retention for **up to 90 days**
* Capture events to **Azure Blob or Data Lake** (Event Hubs Capture)

### 🔃 Architecture:

* Devices/apps send data to **Event Hub**.
* Data goes to **Partitions** (for load balancing).
* **Consumers** read from partitions via **Consumer Groups**.
* Data can be processed in **real time** or **batched**.

### 🔧 Real-Time Use Case: IoT Telemetry Ingestion

1. Thousands of IoT devices send temperature data.
2. Event Hubs ingests and stores the data in partitions.
3. Stream Analytics or Databricks process data in real time.
4. Dashboards show live temperature monitoring.

### ✅ When to Use:

* Real-time analytics
* IoT telemetry ingestion
* Log data processing (e.g., App Insights logs)
* Integration with Apache Kafka ecosystems

---

## 📌 **3. Azure Service Bus** – *Enterprise Messaging Backbone*

### ✅ Overview:

Azure Service Bus is a **fully managed enterprise message broker** supporting complex message workflows and guaranteed delivery.

### 🔍 Key Features:

* Supports **queues and topics** with subscriptions
* **Message sessions**, **transactions**, **dead-lettering**
* **FIFO** ordering
* **Duplicate detection**, scheduled delivery
* Ideal for **decoupled microservices** in complex workflows

### 🎯 Use Case: Order Processing System

1. Order placed by customer (message to a queue)
2. Backend microservices process order, inventory, billing asynchronously
3. Guarantees delivery even if services are temporarily unavailable

### ✅ When to Use:

* Reliable messaging between decoupled services
* Financial applications needing **ordered** and **durable** messages
* Workflows with **complex routing and retry policies**

## 🔄 Event Grid vs Event Hubs vs Service Bus – Comparison

| Feature          | **Event Grid**     | **Event Hubs**               | **Service Bus**      |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Pattern          | Pub/Sub (push)     | Streaming (pull)             | Queue/Topic (pull)   |
| Ideal for        | Lightweight events | High-volume telemetry        | Enterprise workflows |
| Event size       | Small (up to 1MB)  | Small to medium (up to 1MB)  | Large (up to 100MB)  |
| Throughput       | Millions/sec       | Millions/sec                 | Thousands/sec        |
| Latency          | Low (sub-second)   | Low                          | Medium               |
| Ordering         | No                 | Partitioned                  | FIFO (via sessions)  |
