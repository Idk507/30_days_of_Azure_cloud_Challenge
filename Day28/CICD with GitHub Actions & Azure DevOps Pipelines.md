# **CI/CD with GitHub Actions & Azure DevOps Pipelines ‚Äî From Zero to Mastery**

---

## üîπ **PART 1: Understanding CI/CD Concepts**

### ‚ùñ What is CI/CD?

* **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository several times a day.
* **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Automatically deploying validated code to test or production environments.

### ‚ùñ Benefits of CI/CD:

* Faster releases
* Fewer bugs
* Automated workflows
* Better collaboration
* Shorter feedback cycles

## üîπ **PART 2: GitHub Actions ‚Äî Overview & Mastery**

### ‚úÖ What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions lets you **automate workflows directly in your GitHub repo**. It's event-driven and YAML-based.

### ‚úÖ Core Components:

| Term     | Description                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workflow | A YAML file that defines automation (CI/CD steps)       |
| Job      | A unit of work that runs on a VM or container           |
| Step     | A command/script that runs inside a job                 |
| Action   | A reusable script (Docker or JavaScript-based)          |
| Runner   | Server to execute workflows (GitHub-hosted/self-hosted) |

---

### ‚úÖ GitHub Actions Syntax (Workflow Example)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

---

### ‚úÖ Use Cases of GitHub Actions

| Task         | Example                                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Build/Test   | Run unit tests on code push                          |
| Linting      | Auto-run ESLint or Prettier                          |
| Deployment   | Deploy to Azure App Service or Azure Static Web Apps |
| Docker       | Build and push images to ACR or DockerHub            |
| Notification | Post results to Slack, Teams, or email               |

---

### ‚úÖ Azure Deployment with GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Deploy to Azure

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Azure Login
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: Deploy to Web App
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
          app-name: 'my-azure-app'
          package: '.'
```

## üîπ **PART 3: Azure DevOps Pipelines ‚Äî Overview & Mastery**

### ‚úÖ What is Azure DevOps Pipeline?

Azure Pipelines provide **CI/CD automation** for any project hosted in **Azure Repos**, **GitHub**, or other Git providers.

---

### ‚úÖ Pipeline Types:

| Type           | Description                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Classic        | GUI-based (drag-and-drop)    |
| YAML Pipelines | Code-as-infrastructure style |

---

### ‚úÖ Basic Azure Pipeline YAML Example

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: UseNode@1
  inputs:
    version: '18.x'

- script: npm install
  displayName: 'Install dependencies'

- script: npm run build
  displayName: 'Build the app'

- script: npm test
  displayName: 'Run tests'
```

---

### ‚úÖ Deployment Using Azure DevOps

#### Example: Deploy to Azure App Service

```yaml
- task: AzureWebApp@1
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<Azure-Service-Connection>'
    appName: 'my-azure-app'
    package: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/**/*.zip'
```

## üîπ **PART 6: Best Practices**

* Use **branch filters** (`main`, `dev`) to separate staging/prod environments
* Use **secrets and encrypted tokens**
* Keep pipelines **modular and reusable**
* Add **tests and linting** as part of CI
* Enable **status checks** before merge
* Integrate **manual approvals** for production
* Monitor deployments with **Azure Monitor or GitHub Checks**
